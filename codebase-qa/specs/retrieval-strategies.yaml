# Retrieval Strategies for Code Q&A
# Defines parameters for the adaptive retriever based on query intent.

ARCHITECTURE:
  k: 15
  expand_query: true
  include_module_overview: true
  description: "For broad questions about system design, retrieve more chunks (k=15) and expand the query to find related concepts. Include module overviews for context."

IMPLEMENTATION:
  k: 8
  expand_query: false
  exact_function_match: true
  description: "For questions about how a specific feature is built, retrieve fewer, more precise chunks (k=8) and prioritize exact matches for function names."

DEPENDENCY:
  k: 5
  filter_by_imports: true
  description: "For questions about dependencies, retrieve a small number of chunks (k=5) and filter results to focus on import/export statements."

USAGE:
  k: 10
  boost_examples: true
  description: "For questions about how to use a class or function, retrieve a moderate number of chunks (k=10) and boost the ranking of examples and test files."

DEBUGGING:
  k: 12
  include_error_paths: true
  description: "For debugging questions, retrieve a larger number of chunks (k=12) and include context around error handling and potential failure paths."

LOCATION:
  k: 3
  exact_name_match: true
  description: "For questions asking for the location of code, retrieve a very small number of chunks (k=3) and require an exact name match."

GENERAL:
  k: 10
  expand_query: false
  description: "A default strategy for general questions, retrieving a moderate number of chunks (k=10) without query expansion."
