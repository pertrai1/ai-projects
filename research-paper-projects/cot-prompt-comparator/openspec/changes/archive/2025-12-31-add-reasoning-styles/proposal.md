# Proposal: Add Concise vs. Verbose Reasoning Extension

This proposal outlines the work required to implement the "Concise vs. Verbose Reasoning" extension. This corresponds to one of the optional extensions in Phase 7 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to explore how the verbosity of the reasoning affects the model's performance. This will involve creating two new prompt types: one that encourages concise reasoning and another that encourages verbose reasoning.
