# Proposal: Add Prompt Construction

This proposal outlines the work required to implement the standard and chain-of-thought prompts for the Chain-of-Thought Prompt Comparator. This corresponds to Phase 3 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to create two distinct prompt structures: a standard prompt (question -> answer) and a chain-of-thought prompt (question -> reasoning -> answer). These prompts will be kept minimal and consistent to ensure that the only difference is the reasoning structure.
