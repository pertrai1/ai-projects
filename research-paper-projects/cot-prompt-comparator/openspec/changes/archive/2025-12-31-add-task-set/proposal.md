# Proposal: Add Task Set

This proposal outlines the work required to create a small, interpretable task set for the Chain-of-Thought Prompt Comparator. This corresponds to Phase 2 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to define ~10–15 tasks across different categories and populate the `tasks.json` file with these tasks. Each task will include an `id`, `question`, `expectedAnswer`, and `category`.
