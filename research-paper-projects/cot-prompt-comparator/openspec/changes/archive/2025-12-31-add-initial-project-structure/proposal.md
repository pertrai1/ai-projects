# Proposal: Add Initial Project Structure

This proposal outlines the work required to establish the initial project skeleton for the Chain-of-Thought Prompt Comparator. This corresponds to Phase 1 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to create the basic directory structure and placeholder files for a TypeScript project, ensuring that the project can be built and run without errors.
