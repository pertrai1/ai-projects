# Proposal: Add Answer Extraction and Evaluation

This proposal outlines the work required to extract final answers from the model outputs and evaluate them. This corresponds to Phase 5 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to quantitatively compare the performance of the standard and chain-of-thought prompts. This will involve extracting the final answer from the raw model outputs, comparing it against the ground truth, and recording the results.
