# Proposal: Add Model Execution

This proposal outlines the work required to run the prompts and store the raw model outputs. This corresponds to Phase 4 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to execute both the standard and chain-of-thought prompts for each task in the task set, using the Google Gemini API. The raw model outputs will be stored for later analysis.
