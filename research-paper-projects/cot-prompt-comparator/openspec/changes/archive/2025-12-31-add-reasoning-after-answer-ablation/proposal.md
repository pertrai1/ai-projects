# Proposal: Add Reasoning-After-Answer Ablation Extension

This proposal outlines the work required to implement the "Reasoning-After-Answer Ablation" extension. This corresponds to one of the optional extensions in Phase 7 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to explore how asking for reasoning after the answer affects the model's performance. This will involve creating a new prompt type that asks for the reasoning after the answer has been given.
