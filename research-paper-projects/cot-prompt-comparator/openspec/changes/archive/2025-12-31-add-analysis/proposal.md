# Proposal: Add Analysis and Reflection

This proposal outlines the work required to analyze the results and provide a summary of the findings. This corresponds to Phase 6 of the project roadmap.

The goal is to convert the evaluation results into a better understanding of the performance of chain-of-thought prompting. This will involve comparing the accuracy of the standard and chain-of-thought prompts, as well as analyzing the performance by task category.
