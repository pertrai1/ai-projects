### [Flower Recognition](./flower-recognition)
A TypeScript implementation of a CNN-based flower classification system using TensorFlow.js.

**Technology**: TensorFlow.js, TypeScript, Convolutional Neural Networks

**Description**: This supervised learning project trains a deep learning model to identify 5 different types of flowers (Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip) from images. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract visual features and classify flower images with high accuracy.

**Key Features**:
- Image classification for 5 flower species
- Data augmentation for improved model generalization
- Type-safe implementation with full TypeScript support
- Real-time training metrics and validation accuracy
- Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns

**Use Cases**: Gardening apps, educational tools, photography/social media auto-tagging, agriculture research
